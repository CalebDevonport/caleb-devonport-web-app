    <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    <p>This is where I'll be writing about anything I'm interested in, particular achievements I'm proud of, or just anything I fancy discussing.</p>
    <p>Expect posts on: gaming, particular books I've enjoyed reading, coffee related stuff, and I'll maybe put some tech blogs in here at some point too.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy reading some of my thoughts on these topics. 
      If you have any comments or want to discuss, then feel free to contact me through any of the options on the contact page.</p>
